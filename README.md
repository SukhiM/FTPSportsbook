## For The People Sportsbook - Social Sportsbook

The Sportsbook market in the USA has reached 7.4 billion dollars in revenue in 2022
among the 34 states that have made it legal to play. For The People Sportsbook plans to disrupt
this market by offering services that would benefit users who use FTP Sportsbook over
competitors. SimulatorTM, a distinguishing service available to our users, is a simulator that
would allow users to simulate scores of games to gain insight and make better bets. FTP
Sportsbook will offer a social aspect to it that would allow users to build a following to interact
with something other sportsbooks do not offer. We welcome all sports fans whether you are a
casual sports fan who plays once in a while or a professional bettor who plays regularly, these
features unique to FTP sportsbook are here to build a community of sports fans who love to roll
the dice responsibly.
Our vision is to compete with the big sports betting apps such as Draftkings and Fanduel
by offering a unique experience to our target audience. Our target audience consists of all
sportsbook users in the sports betting market, a market worth currently 250 billion dollars, these
users have the liberty to pick and choose their sports betting app so logically they would choose
the one that best caters to them. Our strategy is to win sports bettors over by offering them a
unique experience, one that helps them win more.
